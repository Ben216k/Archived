Archived is a simple Mac app for making file archives with some decent features, like sorting, tags, search stuff, etc. It's very rudimentary, so don't expect much, but give it a try if you're looking for a simple archival app.

2. Download the latest release (`Archived.zip`).

### FAQ
Q: Why is it in beta?
A: Because it's I'm not sure what features I need to add from when I originally started it (or bugs that stand). This is an old project that has been revived.

Okay, I ran out of ideas. Give me questions.
